### For The Time Being,
We find ourselves housed on Discord and must respect or at least follow the Terms-Of-Service there. 
Sadly though as a consequence of that and the nature of this community, there are certain issues we might have to relent on and others we may have to enforce on the communtiy -- that may even be counter to our beliefs. 
It's certainly a platform 'of the world' but it is so far ahead of the competitors in the space, imo, it's worth trying to make the connections (ie: buid the social capital) there, and effectively use it as an ark elsewhere when the time comes. In the interim we will try to be clear and explict where the boundaries are.
